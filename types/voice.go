type Voice struct {
	FileID       string `json:"file_id"`             // Identifier for this file, which can be used to download or reuse the file
	FileUniqueID string `json:"file_unique_id"`      // Unique identifier for this file, which is supposed to be the same over time and for different bots. Can't be used to download or reuse the file.
	Duration     int32  `json:"duration"`            // Duration of the audio in seconds as defined by the sender
	MimeType     string `json:"mime_type,omitempty"` // Optional. MIME type of the file as defined by the sender
	FileSize     int64  `json:"file_size,omitempty"` // Optional. File size in bytes. It can be bigger than 2^31 and some programming languages may have difficulty/silent defects in interpreting it. But it has at most 52 significant bits, so a signed 64-bit integer or double-precision float type are safe for storing this value.
