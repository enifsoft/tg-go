type File struct {
	FileID       string `json:"file_id"`             // Identifier for this file, which can be used to download or reuse the file
	FileUniqueID string `json:"file_unique_id"`      // Unique identifier for this file, which is supposed to be the same over time and for different bots. Can't be used to download or reuse the file.
	FileSize     int64  `json:"file_size,omitempty"` // Optional. File size in bytes. It can be bigger than 2^31 and some programming languages may have difficulty/silent defects in interpreting it. But it has at most 52 significant bits, so a signed 64-bit integer or double-precision float type are safe for storing this value.
	FilePath     string `json:"file_path,omitempty"` // Optional. File path. Use https://api.telegram.org/file/bot<token>/<file_path> to get the file.
